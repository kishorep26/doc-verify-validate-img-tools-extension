# Privacy Policy for Document Verify & Image Tools

**Last Updated: January 2, 2026**

## Overview

Document Verify & Image Tools ("the Extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how we handle data when you use our Chrome extension.

## Data Collection and Usage

### What Data We Collect

**We collect NO personal data.** The Extension operates entirely on your local device and does not transmit any information to external servers.

### Local Storage

The Extension uses Chrome's local storage API (`chrome.storage`) to save:
- User preferences and settings
- Tool configurations (e.g., last used image processing settings)

This data is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted, shared, or accessed by us or any third parties.

### Document Verification

When you verify Aadhar or PAN card numbers:
- All validation is performed locally in your browser using JavaScript algorithms
- No document numbers or verification results are stored, transmitted, or logged
- The Extension does not have access to actual document images or scans

### Image Processing

When you process images:
- All image processing (resize, crop, compress, convert) happens entirely in your browser
- Images are processed using HTML5 Canvas API on your local device
- No images are uploaded to any server or transmitted over the internet
- Processed images are downloaded directly to your device

## Permissions Explained

The Extension requests the following permissions:

### Storage Permission
- **Purpose**: To save your preferences and settings locally
- **Data Stored**: User interface preferences, last used tool settings
- **Location**: Local device only (Chrome's local storage)

### Downloads Permission
- **Purpose**: To save processed images to your device
- **Usage**: Only activated when you click to download a processed image
- **Scope**: Limited to images you explicitly choose to process and download

## Data Sharing

**We do not share any data** because we do not collect any data. The Extension:
- Does not communicate with external servers
- Does not use analytics or tracking
- Does not contain advertisements
- Does not share information with third parties

## Third-Party Services

The Extension does not integrate with or use any third-party services, APIs, or analytics platforms.

## Data Security

Since all processing happens locally on your device:

- You maintain complete control over your data

## Children's Privacy

The Extension does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.
